Redash (Wild edition) Server
============================

This is a "wild" fork of Redash project:  

- Extracted back-end part to build and deploy separately
- HTTP API-level compatibility is a goal
- Codebase backwards compatibility is not a goal
- Dependencies are updated to the latest versions
- PostgreSQL of version 15.x is used
- Database migrations history is cleaned up to start from scratch


Overview
--------

- Back-end part is extracted to the separate repo (this one)
- Backwards compatibility is not a goal, it's a spin-off
- Existing features will be revised, some new features will be added

In summary, our project involves forking Redash with the intention of improving it and creating a new product. We value the original work and aim to appreciate and contribute to it while also developing our own unique vision.

When forking an original work, it is important to appreciate the effort and value of the original creators while also acknowledging the need for changes and improvements. We believe that the best way to do this is to be transparent about our intentions and to give credit to the original creators and contributors.

Our approach involves collaborating with the Redash community to contribute back to the original project if possible while also maintaining a separate codebase for our own project.
