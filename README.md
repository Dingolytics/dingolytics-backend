In summary, our project involves forking Redash with the intention of improving it and creating a new product. We value the original work and aim to appreciate and contribute to it while also developing our own unique vision.

When forking an original work, it is important to appreciate the effort and value of the original creators while also acknowledging the need for changes and improvements. We believe that the best way to do this is to be transparent about our intentions and to give credit to the original creators and contributors.

Our approach involves collaborating with the Redash community to contribute back to the original project if possible while also maintaining a separate codebase for our own project.
